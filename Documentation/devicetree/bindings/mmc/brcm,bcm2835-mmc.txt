Broadcom BCM2835 Arasan EMMC controller

This file documents differences between the core properties described
by mmc.txt and the properties that represent the BCM2835 controller.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "brcm,bcm2835-mmc".
- clocks : The clock feeding the EMMC controller.
- dmas : DMA specifiers for tx and rx dma.
- dma-names: RX and TX  DMA request names.

Example:

mmc: mmc@7e300000 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm2835-mmc";
		reg = <0x7e300000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <2 30>;
		clocks = <&clk_mmc>;
		dmas = <&dma 5>,
		<&dma 5>;
		dma-names = "tx", "rx";
		status = "disabled";
}
